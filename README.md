# Computer Vision Problems

Practicing OpenCV, to avoid getting rusty, using the free-online course given by awsomeness Adrian, creator of the . [PyImageSearch](https://www.pyimagesearch.com).

### No. 1 -  Face Recognition
Perform fast, accurate face detection with OpenCV using a pre-trained deep learning face detector model shipped with the library.

### No. 2 -  OpenCV Guide
Learning OpenCV isn’t as hard as it used to be. And in fact, I’ll go as far as to say studying OpenCV has become significantly easier.

### No. 3 -  Scan a Document
Building a document scanner with OpenCV can be accomplished in just three simple steps:
1. Detect edges.
2. Use the edges in the image to find the contour (outline) representing the piece of paper being scanned.
3. Apply a perspective transform to obtain the top-down view of the document.
